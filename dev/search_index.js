The set of one dimensional subspaces, i.e. the projective plane, of V is denoted by mathrmPG(2q). There are q^2+q+1 such subspaces, which are the vertices of the Erdos-Renyi graph mathrmER(q). Two vertices are adjacent if they are distinct and orthogonal, i.e. for two representing vectors x and y we have x^Ty=0. We are interested in the size of a maximum stable set of these graphs, specifically upper bounds for this value.
